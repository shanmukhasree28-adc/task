The Food Delivery App is a user-friendly platform designed to make ordering food quick and convenient. With a modern and intuitive interface, the app allows users to easily browse through a diverse selection of meals, from pizzas and burgers to sushi and pasta. Users can add their favorite dishes to the cart, review their selections, and place an orderâ€”all with just a few clicks. Built with React on the frontend and Express on the backend, the app ensures a smooth and responsive experience across devices. While the current version provides a simple cart and order submission system, future updates will include payment integrations, user authentication, and real-time order tracking, making it a comprehensive solution for food delivery.
