The Quick Feedback App is a simple and efficient web application designed to collect anonymous feedback from users in real-time. Built with a React frontend and a Node.js + Express backend, the app allows users to submit feedback quickly through a clean, user-friendly interface. Submitted messages are instantly stored and displayed, enabling organizers, teams, or administrators to view and track user input effectively. This lightweight and fast-to-deploy solution is ideal for hackathons, events, classrooms, or internal team use where real-time, anonymous feedback is valuable. The app is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements like user authentication, database integration, and admin dashboards.
